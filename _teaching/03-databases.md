[Databases](/databases)&nbsp;{%- include lang.liquid text="数据库原理及应用" %} is a course on, well, databases at [Hefei University](https://www.hfuu.edu.cn/english)&nbsp;{%- include lang.liquid text="合肥大学" url="https://www.hfuu.edu.cn" %}.
The {% include taglink.liquid tag="teaching" tag_text="teaching material" %} is freely available, including a [book](/databases/databases.pdf) in English language, [a set of slides](/databases/#k7) in German language, a [GitHub repository](http://github.com/thomasWeise/databasesCode) with many examples, and a collection of [exercises](/databasesQuestions/databasesPythonQuestions.pdf).
This is an undergraduate course of 48&nbsp;units, 32&nbsp;of which are theory and 16&nbsp;are practice-centered.
We focus on practical experience with databases, which means that we work with an actual database management system&nbsp;([PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)) and get to know many tools, including [yEd](https://yed.yworks.com), [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) Base, [Psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org), and the [pgModeler](https://pgmodeler.io).
