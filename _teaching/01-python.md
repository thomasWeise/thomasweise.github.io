[Programming with Python](/programmingWithPython) (Python程序设计) is a course on Python programming.
The teaching material is freely available, including a [book](/programmingWithPython/programmingWithPython.pdf) in English language, [a set of slides](/programmingWithPython/#k7) in German language, and a [GitHub repository](http://github.com/thomasWeise/programmingWithPythonCode) with many example programs.
This is an undergraduate course of 48&nbsp;units, 32&nbsp;of which are theory and 16&nbsp;are practice-centered.
We focus on practical experience with Python, which means that we do not just learn the basics of programming, but also good programming style and various tools, ranging from [MyPy](https://www.mypy-lang.org) over [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff) and [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org) to [pytest](https://pytest.org).
