Ant Colony Optimization&nbsp;(ACO) is a {% include taglink.liquid tag="si" tag_text="swarm intelligence" %} {% include taglink.liquid tag="metaheuristic" %} for optimization problems whose solutions can be represented as paths through graphs.
Such paths are generated by simulated ants moving from node to node in a simulated graph.
On each vertex, they decide where to go next based on the accumulated simulated pheromone on edges and an edge-based heuristic&nbsp;(usually the objective value).
They fall into the family of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms&nbsp;({% include taglink.liquid tag="edas" %}), which comprises all metaheuristics that iteratively construct and refine statistical models of the search space and that use this model to sample new candidate solutions.
