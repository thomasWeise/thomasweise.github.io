Estimation of Distribution Algorithms&nbsp;(EDAs) are {% include taglink.liquid tag="metaheuristic" tag_text="metaheuristics" %} that iteratively build and refine a statistical model of the solution space and use this model to sample candidate solutions.
The most well-known member of this family of algorithms is Ant Colony Optimization&nbsp;({% include taglink.liquid tag="aco" %}).
