Local search algorithms are {% include taglink.liquid tag="metaheuristic" tag_text="metaheuristics" %} that maintain one single solution and sample a new one in each iteration.
The most well-known examples for these algorithms are maybe randomized local search&nbsp;({% include taglink.liquid tag="RLS" -%}), hill climbing, and the (1+1)&nbsp;EA.
Well-known local search algorithms with provisions to escape from local optima are {% include taglink.liquid tag="tabu_search" -%} and Simulated Annealing&nbsp;({% include taglink.liquid tag="SA" -%}).
