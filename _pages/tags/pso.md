Particle Swarm Optimization&nbsp;(PSO) is a {% include taglink.liquid tag="si" tag_text="swarm intelligence" %} method for numerical optimization.
Here, the candidate solutions are represented by particles flying through&nbsp;${\mathbb{R}}^n$, each having a velocity vector.
The velocities of the particles are influenced by neighboring particles and by the objective function via best-so-far positions.
