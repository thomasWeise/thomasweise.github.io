In the [`pycommons`](/pycommons) project, several Python functions that are shared between my Python projects are provided.
These include, for example, a unified build process, used by [`moptipy`](/moptipy), [`moptipyapps`](/moptipyapps), the [`texgit`](/texgit_py) Python package, and [`pycommons`](/pycommons) itself.
There also are some rudimentary statistical functions, caches, math routines, string handling routines, a `Path` object, and so on.
In short, this is my tool belt for Python projects.
