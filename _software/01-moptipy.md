excerpt: "[moptipy](/moptipy)&nbsp;is a library with implementations of metaheuristic optimization methods in Python that also offers an environment for replicable experiments.
Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are methods for solving hard problems.
[moptipy](/moptipy)&nbsp;provides an API, several algorithm implementations, as well as experiment execution and evaluation facilities for metaheuristics.
Here you can find a small presentation outlining some of the concepts of the system.
[moptipy](/moptipy)&nbsp;is structured with performance, ease-of-use, and generality in mind, but also based on an educational and research perspective.
It is therefore (hopefully) suitable for practical industrial applications, scientific research, and for students who are just entering the field of metaheuristic optimization."
